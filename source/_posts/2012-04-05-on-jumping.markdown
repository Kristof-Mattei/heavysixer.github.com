{% blockquote John Burroughs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burroughs %}
Jump and the net will appear.
{% endblockquote %}

Seven years ago there was much handwringing around leaving my job to start my own consultancy. That is until my friend told me this quote from John Burroughs. It is a compelling illustration about faith in yourself and that the world values you. It often resurfaces for me when I am mulling over a risky proposition. The best thing about this quote is when properly applied, if the net doesn't appear... well it won't hurt long!
