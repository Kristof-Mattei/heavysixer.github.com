Aside from it being an *epic* pun, what does it mean to be a functionally illiterate developer? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When someone cannot read or write in their native language, they are considered functionally illiterate. This 
level of illiteracy means that they subsist in their daily life through their ability to speak fluently, and 
recognize certain written keywords. Illiteracy is not a sign of stupidity; in many cases it is the result a lack 
of opportunity to learn. However, illiteracy does stunt the potential of otherwise bright people. The sad fact is 
their inability to participate in society through the mastery of language makes them at higher risk of being in 
poverty and committing crime.

Most computer languages are written, not spoken (try speaking JavaScript out loud and you'll see what I mean). 
Therefore, being able to write code does not make you literate. Being an illiterate developer means that you skim 
across the surface of the language, copying snippets of code from others trying cobble, together a working program with 
little or no understanding of how or why it works.

As with illiterates in the wider world, illiterate developers are not unintelligent. Often it means that they 
didn't have the luxury of taking a deep dive through the mechanics of the programming language. Many illiterate 
developers are practicing software professionals, backed into a corner by impending deadlines, or lack of 
resources. Perhaps they started in other fields such as graphic design, or business and find themselves scurrying 
along the surface of the language, learning in fits and starts as they go along.
