I find it helpful to decompose questions into buckets to help my decision making.


### Example: “Can we launch our rocket next year on December 25th?”

**What We Know** – Dimensions of the problem we understand e.g. Our rocket will fly under ideal conditions.

**What We Know We Don’t Know** – Missing expertise or facts which are needed but can be attained: e.g. Are there other rockets scheduled to launch that same day?

**What We Don’t Know We Don’t Know** – Information helpful to understand the problem but we are unaware we should consider it: e.g. Will our rocket perform well in cold weather?

**What We Know We Don’t Know but Is Unknowable** – Information which is temporal, or you have no way to capture it e.g. what will the exact temperature for a given day next year?
